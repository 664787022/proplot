==============

This page contain links to related projects and projects that inspired ProPlot.

* `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/api.html>`__ is the venerable NetCDF data package. If you haven't heard of it and you work with NetCDF files, it will change your life.
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__ translates spreadsheets and tables into annotated numpy arrays. Also invaluable for certain types of data.
* `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org>`__ is a statistical data visualization package. It has some awesome features, but few people in my field use it because it is geared more toward statistical data than geophysical data and other data types.
* `colorbrewer <http://colorbrewer2.org/>`__ is the O.G. perceptually uniform colormap release, included with matplotlib by default.
* `cmocean <https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/>`__ is a beautiful set of colormaps for visualizing oceanographic data. They have been added to ProPlot.
* `sciviscolor <https://sciviscolor.org/home/colormoves/>`__ is an online interactive tool that provides a ton of maps for *merging* and *combining*, suitable for complex datasets with weird statistical distributions. These have been added to ProPlot.
