=======
ProPlot
=======

A powerful, easy-to-use `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics. The Github page is `here <https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot>`__.

Installation
============

This package is a work-in-progress -- currently, there is no formal release
on PyPi (but it's coming soon!). For the time being, you may install directly from Github using:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git#egg=proplot

The dependencies are `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.  The optional geographic mapping features require `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ and/or `basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_.

Importing
=========

I recommend importing ProPlot with

.. code-block:: python

   import proplot as plot

This differentiates ProPlot from the usual "``plt``" abbreviation used for the `~matplotlib.pyplot` module.

Overview
========

Importing ProPlot registers a bunch of new colormaps and color names.
If this is all you want and you don't care about other features, simply
import ProPlot at the top of your script. See `~proplot.colortools` and the :ref:`Registered colormaps`, :ref:`Registered color cycles`, and :ref:`Registered color names` tables for details.

Most of ProPlot's features derive from the `~proplot.subplots.subplots` command, inspired
by the pyplot `~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` command.
This generates a scaffolding of specially subclassed axes, and has a bunch of other useful features.

The next most important utility is the `~proplot.axes.BaseAxes.format` method, available
on every axes generated by `~proplot.subplots.subplots`. Use this method to fine-tune your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

Here are some highlights of the remaining features:

*  Specify figure, axes, panel, etc. sizes with arbitrary physical units 
   or pixels -- not just inches.
*  A smarter "tight layout" feature. Figure width or height alternately
   scales so that subplot aspect ratios are fixed, inner space
   between subplots automatically scaled so subplot tick labels, etc. do
   not overlap with each other.
*  Axes panels and figure panels, for global colorbars, global legends,
   or tertiary data. Panel widths always held fixed during "tight layout"
   scaling.
*  Automatic axes, colorbar, and legend formatting when
   `xarray.DataArray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, or `pandas.Series` objects are passed
   to a plotting command, just like their respective ``plot`` methods.
*  Easy setting customization with a user ``.proplotrc`` file. Option
   to save custom colormaps, and they will be loaded every time on startup.
*  Perceptually distinct named colors with easy-to-remember names,
   a ton of beautiful new colormaps, new property cycle colors.
*  Tools for merging existing colormaps and making new "perceptually
   uniform" colormaps on-the-fly. Tools for slicing and modifying existing
   colormaps.
*  Making colorbars from lists of lines
   or colors. Making axes "inset" colorbars. Making legends with centered
   rows instead of aligned columns.
*  Integration with basemap and cartopy. Generate arbitrary
   grids of arbitrary map projections in one go. Switch between the cartopy and
   basemap backends painlessly. Use the axes methods directly for basemap
   plotting, instead of the ``Basemap`` object.
*  Add geographic features with the ``format`` command.
   Customize geographic gridlines and gridline labels.
