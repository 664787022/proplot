Quick overview
==============


Color usage tools
-----------------

Importing ProPlot registers a bunch of new colormaps and color names.
If this is all you want and you don't care about other features, simply
import ProPlot at the top of your script. See :ref:`Color usage` for details.

Top-level commands
------------------

ProPlot's features derive from the `~proplot.subplots.subplots` and `~proplot.subplots.figure` commands, inspired
by the pyplot `~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` and `~matplotlib.pyplot.figure`
commands.
This creates a special `~proplot.subplots.Figure` subclass, whose `~proplot.subplots.Figure.add_subplot` method draws special `~proplot.axes.Axes` subclasses.
The features provided by `~proplot.subplots.subplots` and `~proplot.subplots.figure` are numerous; check out the documenation for details.

Figure and axes commands
------------------------
The new `~proplot.subplots.Figure` and `~proplot.axes.Axes` classes
override various matplotlib methods to implement tons of useful features.

The next most important utility is the ``format`` method, available on every axes generated by ``subplots``. Use this method to fine-tune your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

Other features
--------------

Here are some highlights of the remaining features:

*  Improvements to and automatic application of the
   `tight layout <https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html>`__ 
   feature. Figure width and height is allowed to vary
   so that subplot aspect ratios remain fixed, which is particularly useful
   for grids of map projections and images. Arbitrary physical units, including
   *metric* units like ``cm`` and ``mm``, can be used for sizing arguments.
*  Axes panels and figure panels, generally used for colorbars and legends
   that refer to multiple subplots at once. New "inset" colorbars.
   Colorbars from lists of lines or colors. Legends with centered
   rows instead of aligned columns.
*  Helpful ``Locator``, ``Formatter``, ``Scale``, ``Proj``, ``Norm``, ``Colormap``,
   and ``Cycle`` constructor functions, integrated with the ``format`` command,
   ``subplots`` command, and plotting commands. More power and less boilerplate code.
*  Automatic axes, colorbar, and legend formatting when
   ``xarray.DataArray``, ``pandas.DataFrame``, or ``pandas.Series`` objects are passed
   to a plotting command, just like their respective ``plot`` methods.
*  Beautiful new colormaps, named "color cycles", and easy-to-remember
   color names. Tools for merging colormaps and making new "perceptually
   uniform" colormaps on-the-fly. Tools for slicing and modifying existing
   colormaps.
*  Global setting customization with a user ``.proplotrc`` file. Save custom
   colormaps, color cycles, and fonts in a user ``.proplot`` folder, and they
   will be loaded every time on startup.
*  Integration with basemap and cartopy. Generate arbitrary
   grids of arbitrary map projections in one go. Switch between the cartopy and
   basemap backends painlessly. Simplified plotting commands.
   Add geographic features and custom meridian and parallel gridlines and
   labels with the ``format`` command.
