Past and current contributors
=============================
`Luke Davis <https://github.com/lukelbd`__ is the sole developer, as of November 2019. Luke is a graduate student in climate science at Colorado State University who has always been frustrated by repetitive plotting tasks. Ever since his undergraduate days, he has wanted to make this easier. He began by developing an extensive set of MATLAB plotting utilities for personal use. When he switched to python in graduate school, he translated most of these utilities to python, learned more about the language, began to rapidly develop them, and decided they were worth sharing with the world.
Luke is also a vim enthusiast and has authored `a number of vim plugins <https://github.com/lukelbd?tab=repositories>`__.

`Riley Brady <https://github.com/bradyrx>`__ is another important contributor. You can thank him for his recommendations on how to organize this project, set up automatic testing, allow new contributors to join, and deploy it to the world. He is also the earliest user of ProPlot and helped Luke fix a lot of the initial bugs. If your field is atmospheric science, check out his `decadal climate prediction package <https://github.com/bradyrx/climpred>`__.
