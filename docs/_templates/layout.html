  The css_files method: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32079202/4970632
  Critical to use pathto() instead of "_static/custom.css" because auto
  generated docs are in "api" subfolder so link becomes invalid!
  Use extrahead because it is recommended in templating instructions, css_files
  method does *not require* pathto() but do not understand why, seems sketchy
