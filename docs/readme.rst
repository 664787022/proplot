ProPlot
=======

A library providing helpful and versatile plotting utilities
for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics with ease.

Installation
============

This package is a work-in-progress. Currently there is no formal release
on PyPi. However, feel free to install directly from Github using:

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git#egg=proplot

Dependencies are `matplotlib` and `numpy`. The geographic mapping
mapping features require `cartopy` and/or `basemap`.

Overview
========

Import with

::

   import proplot as plot

On import, a bunch of new colormaps and string color names are registered.
If you just want the new colors and don't want to use any other features, simply
add ``import proplot`` at the top of your script.

The remaining features mostly derive from the `~proplot.subplots.subplots` command, inspired
by the pyplot `~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots` command. This generates a scaffolding
of axes with new, helpful methods. It also has a bunch of other useful features, like "panels" and built-in geographic projections.

The next most important utility is the `~proplot.axes.BaseAxes.format` method, available
on every axes generated by `~proplot.subplots.subplots`. Use this method to fine-tune
your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

.. This is just so top-level headers in the showcase.rst
   file appear as *subsections* in the documentation to
   a parent 'showcase' section.

Showcase

Below is a showcase of ProPlot's features. See :ref:`getting started` for an
introduction, and :ref:`documentation` for details once you get the hang of
the API.
