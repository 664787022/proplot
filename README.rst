A comprehensive, easy-to-use `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics.

Installation
------------

This package is a work-in-progress. Currently there is no formal release
on PyPi (coming soon!). However, feel free to install directly from Github using:

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git#egg=proplot

The dependencies are `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.  The optional geographic mapping features require `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ and/or `basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_.

Importing
---------
I recommend importing ProPlot with

.. code-block:: python

   import proplot as plot

This differentiates ProPlot from the usual "``plt``" abbreviation used for the ``pyplot`` module.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is `published on readthedocs <https://proplot.readthedocs.io>`_.

Donations
---------
At well over 10,000 lines of code, this package took a huge amount of time to write and an equally huge amount of time to share online -- especially with my day job as a graduate student. If ProPlot has been useful for you, consider clicking the "donate" badge and sending me a small donation.

Overview
--------

Importing ProPlot registers a bunch of new colormaps and color names.
If this is all you want and you don't care about other features, simply
import ProPlot at the top of your script. See the documentation for details.

Most of ProPlot's features derive from the ``subplots`` command, inspired
by the pyplot command of the same name.
This generates a scaffolding of specially subclassed axes, and has a bunch of other useful features.

The next most important utility is the ``format`` method, available on every axes generated by ``subplots``. Use this method to fine-tune your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

Here are some highlights of the remaining features:

*  A smarter "tight layout" feature. Figure width or height changed
   so that subplot aspect ratios are fixed. Inner space between subplots
   automatically scaled so subplot tick labels, etc. do
   not overlap. Arbitrary physical units (e.g. ``cm``, ``mm``) when specifying
   dimensions and sizes.
*  Axes panels and figure panels, generally used for colorbars and legends
   that refer to multiple subplots at once. New "inset" colorbars.
   Colorbars from lists of lines or colors. Legends with centered
   rows instead of aligned columns.
*  Helpful ``Locator``, ``Formatter``, ``Scale``, ``Proj``, ``Norm``, ``Colormap``,
   and ``Cycle`` constructor functions, integrated with the ``format`` command,
   ``subplots`` command, and plotting commands. More power and less boilerplate code.
*  Automatic axes, colorbar, and legend formatting when
   `xarray.DataArray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, or `pandas.Series` objects are passed
   to a plotting command, just like their respective ``plot`` methods.
*  Beautiful new colormaps, named "color cycles", and easy-to-remember
   color names. Tools for merging colormaps and making new "perceptually
   uniform" colormaps on-the-fly. Tools for slicing and modifying existing
   colormaps.
*  Global setting customization with a user ``.proplotrc`` file. Save custom
   colormaps, color cycles, and fonts in a user ``.proplot`` folder, and they
   will be loaded every time on startup.
*  Integration with basemap and cartopy. Generate arbitrary
   grids of arbitrary map projections in one go. Switch between the cartopy and
   basemap backends painlessly. Simplified plotting commands.
   Add geographic features and custom meridian and parallel gridlines and
   labels with the ``format`` command.

Why not add to matplotlib directly?
-----------------------------------
This project can be thought of as "matplotlib for power users."
Many of its features represent an alternative to the existing matplotlib API -- and
following `TOOWTDI <https://wiki.python.org/moin/TOOWTDI>`__ philosophy,
they should perhaps remain here as a side project. For example: the ``format`` and ``format_partial`` methods, which are meant to replace existing axes and axis methods.

.. Some features could be relatively esoteric for the average user (for example,
   "perceptually uniform" colormaps), or could be seen as "convenience features" that perhaps do not belong with the core API for the sake of minimalism (for example, direct integration
   with cartographic toolkits).

There are also some philosophical differences and more direct conflicts.
ProPlot enforces **static** figure scaffoldings, while matplotlib encourages
successively adding axes to an existing figure instance.
The "smart tight layout" feature conflicts directly with
matplotlib's `tight layout <https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html>`__, with more options and the ability
to preserve axes aspect ratios by sacrificing fixed figure dimensions.
And much of ``subplots`` could be seen as a more flexible alternative to
the `axes_grid1 <https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/index.html>`__ toolkit.

Despite all this, if there are any matplotlib developers out there that think
some ProPlot features could be added to matplotlib directly, please contact me!

What about other matplotlib wrappers?
-------------------------------------

There is already a great matplotlib wrapper called `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`__, and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html>`__ and `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/plotting.html>`__ both offer convenient matplotlib plotting commands. What makes this project different?

While parts of ProPlot were inspired by these projects (in particular, ``rctools.py`` and ``colortools.py`` are modeled after seaborn), the goals are largely different. Seaborn, pandas, and xarray offer tools for generating rigid, simple, nice-looking plots from data stored in special objects (``pandas.DataFrame`` and ``xarray.DataArray``). Similarly, ProPlot uses metadata from these special objects and gives you nice-looking plots out of the box -- but critically, it also permits a *high level of customization*, permits building *complex grids of subplots*, and includes powerful tools for working with *colors* and *geographic datasets*. While seaborn, pandas, and xarray are meant to be used separately from the matplotlib API, ProPlot is built *into the matplotlib API*, thanks to special subclasses of the native matplotlib ``Figure`` and ``Axes`` classes.

In summary, this project is intended to unify the convenience of seaborn, pandas, and xarray plotting with the power and customizability of the underlying matplotlib API.
