ProPlot
=======

An `object-oriented <https://matplotlib.org/api/api_overview.html>`__ `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ wrapper
that provides versatile plotting utilities
for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is published `here <https://lukelbd.github.io/proplot>`_.

Installation
------------

This package is a work-in-progress. Currently there is no formal release
on PyPi (coming soon!). However, feel free to install directly from Github using:

::

   pip install git+https://github.com/lukelbd/proplot.git#egg=proplot

The dependencies are `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ and `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.  The optional geographic mapping features require `cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ and/or `basemap <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/index.html>`_.

Overview
--------

Import with

::

   import proplot as plot

Most of the features derive from the `subplots` command, inspired
by the pyplot `subplots` command.

The next most important utility is the `format` method, available on every axes generated by `subplots`. Use this method to fine-tune your axis properties, titles, labels, limits, and much more.

Here are some highlights of the remaining features:

*  A smarter "tight layout" feature. Figure width or height alternately
   scales so that subplot **aspect ratios** are fixed, inner space
   between subplots automatically scaled so subplot tick labels, etc. do
   not overlap with each other.
*  Easy setting customization with a user ``.proplotrc`` file. Option
   to save custom colormaps, and they will be loaded every time on startup.
*  Axes panels and figure panels, for global colorbars, global legends,
   or tertiary data. Panel widths always held fixed during "tight layout"
   scaling.
*  Perceptually distinct named colors with easy-to-remember names,
   a ton of beautiful new colormaps, new property cycle colors.
*  Tools for making new make new merged colormaps and "perceptually
   uniform colormaps" on-the-fly. Tools for slicing and modifying existing
   colormaps.
*  Making colorbars from lists of lines
   or colors. Making axes "inset" colorbars. Making legends with centered
   rows instead of aligned columns.
*  Integration with basemap and cartopy. Generate arbitrary
   grids of map projections in one go. Switch between the cartopy and
   basemap backends painlessly. Using the axes methods directly for basemap
   plotting, instead of the `Basemap` object.
*  Ability to add geographical features with the `format` command.
   Formatting geographic gridlines and labels.

What about seaborn?
-------------------

There is already a great matplotlib wrapper called
`seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`__. What makes this project
different?

While parts of ProPlot were inspired by seaborn (in particular much
of ``colors.py`` is drawn from seaborn’s ``palettes.py``), the goal for
this project was quite different: It is intended to simplify the task
of making publication-quality figures, and no more.

Seaborn largely attempts to merge the tasks of data analysis and
visualization. ProPlot contains no analysis tools – it is expected
that you analyze your data on your own time. Anyway, both `pandas`
and `xarray` already have great built-in tools for visualizing
tabulated and geophysical data --
and if ProPlot is imported, these tools will even work with its new
colormaps.  I was also able
to integrate my features very closely with the matplotlib API (usually
as enhancements of existing `Axes` and
`Figure` methods),
while the `seaborn` features are only accessible from commands on the module
itself.

By focusing on this single task, I've added a number of
powerful features well beyond the scope of `seaborn`.

Contributions
-------------
This entire package has so far been written by just `me <https://github.com/lukelbd>`__ -- but I have a day job as a graduate student. If you have any ideas for new features or come across any bugs, I'd love to receive a pull request! My code should be sufficiently documented and commented so that others are able to modify it.

Donations
---------

At well over 10,000 lines of code, this package took a shocking amount of time to write and to publish... so I'll just
leave this here :)
