These fonts were added from the default site-packages distribution
generally found in
  <base>/lib/python3.6/site-packages/matplotlib//mpl-data/fonts/ttf
and from some default included with the MacOS distribution. The files
in this folder are intended to populate the mpl-data folder on
matplotlib installed for any server. Use the "fontsetup" command to do so;
this shell script will delete the existing font caches.
